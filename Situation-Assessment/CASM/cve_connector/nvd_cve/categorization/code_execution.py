Module for Assessing Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

This module provides functions to determine whether a vulnerability enables an attacker
to execute arbitrary code on a target system. It distinguishes between code execution
with system-level (root/administrator) privileges and code execution as a non-root user.
The analysis is based on a combination of CVSS metrics from different versions (v4.0, v3.1,
v3.0, and v2) and textual analysis of the vulnerability description. These functions are designed
to be used as part of a larger vulnerability classification framework.

Functions:
  - has_code_execution_as_root: Checks if the vulnerability allows remote code execution as root/system.
  - has_code_execution_as_user: Determines if the vulnerability enables remote code execution as a non-root user.

Dependencies:
  - test_incidence, cve_is_about_system from cve_connector.nvd_cve.categorization.utils.
  - Vulnerability from cve_connector.nvd_cve.vulnerability.

    """
    Determines whether the given vulnerability permits remote code execution with root
    (or system-level) privileges.

    This function first scans the vulnerability description for key phrases that directly
    indicate code execution as root (using a predefined list of necessary conditions). If one of these
    phrases is found, the function returns True. Otherwise, it verifies that:
      - The vulnerability is related to a system (using its CPE type).
      - The vulnerability can execute code as a user (by invoking has_code_execution_as_user).
      - The CVSS metrics (v4.0, v3.1, v3.0, or v2) indicate a high impact on confidentiality,
        integrity, and availability.
