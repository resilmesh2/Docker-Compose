Module for Assessing Privilege Gain Vulnerabilities

This module provides functions to determine whether a vulnerability allows an attacker to gain
additional privileges on a target system. The analysis distinguishes between privilege escalation
at the system level (e.g., root/administrator privileges), user-level privilege gain, and application-level
privilege gain. The evaluation is based on both CVSS metrics from various versions (v4.0, v3.1, v3.0, and v2)
and textual analysis of the vulnerability description. These functions are intended for integration
within a comprehensive vulnerability classification framework.

Functions:
  - has_gain_root_privileges: Checks if the vulnerability permits gaining root/system privileges.
  - has_privilege_escalation: Determines if the vulnerability leads to privilege escalation.
  - has_gain_application_privileges: Evaluates if the vulnerability allows application-level privilege gain.
  - has_gain_user_privileges: Assesses whether the vulnerability enables user-level privilege gain.

Dependencies:
  - test_incidence, cve_is_about_application, cve_is_about_system from cve_connector.nvd_cve.categorization.utils.
  - Vulnerability from cve_connector.nvd_cve.vulnerability.
