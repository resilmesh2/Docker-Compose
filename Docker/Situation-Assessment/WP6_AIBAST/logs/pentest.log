The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 23 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.5". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan identified a live host on the network with an unknown operating system, one open port (8080/tcp for http-proxy), but was unable to determine network hops.\n- Changes: New information found includes the open port 8080/tcp (http-proxy) which was not previously known. The OS remains unknown, and network hops are still not available, providing no change in that regard..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.4\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 22 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.4". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan attempted to perform a basic network discovery but did not yield specific results about the OS, open ports, or network hops. It found a node via nmap range scan, but further details remain unknown.\n- Changes: No changes..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.6\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 24 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.6". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan was a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network. It found a node discovered via nmap range scan, but no additional information such as OS, open ports, or network hops was available.\n\n- Changes: No changes..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.2\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 20 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.2". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a basic network discovery and identified a live host on the network. The scan results show that no operating system was detected, and open ports were found, but the number of open ports was not specified. Network hops information is not available.\n\n- Changes: New information about open ports was found, but no OS detection and network hops data. Compared to existing data, open ports information is new..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.1\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 19 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.1".

The scan found a host with an unknown OS, open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy), but was unable to determine network hops.\n\n- Changes: New information found includes the open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy). The OS and network hops information was not previously available, but also did not provide a specific OS. The previous scan only confirmed a live host via nmap range scan..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.3\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 21 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.3". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a basic network discovery to identify live hosts on the network and found a node via nmap range scan.

The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan was a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network. It found a node discovered via nmap range scan, but no additional information such as OS, open ports, or network hops was available.\n\n- Changes: No changes..\nTask 27 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports and the operating system on node 192.168.0.6". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan was a network analysis scan that identified a live host on the network. It found a node with an unknown OS, no open ports identified, and 1 network hop.\n\n- Changes: New information found includes the number of network hops, which was not previously available. The OS and open ports were not identified, providing no additional information in those areas..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.2\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 20 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.2". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a basic network discovery and identified a live host on the network. The scan results show that no operating system was detected, and open ports were found, but the number of open ports was not specified. Network hops information is not available.\n\n- Changes: New information about open ports was found, but no OS detection and network hops data. Compared to existing data, open ports information is new..\nTask 28 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a detailed nmap scan to identify the operating system and specify the number of open ports on node 192.168.0.2". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a network analysis on node 192.168.0.2 and found no operating system detected, no open ports, and no network hops information available.\n- Changes: Compared to existing data, new information was found indicating that there are no open ports detected, and no OS detection and network hops data; replacing previous partial data..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.1\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 19 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.1". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a basic network discovery and identified a live host. The scan found a host with an unknown OS, open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy), but was unable to determine network hops.\n\n- Changes: New information found includes the open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy). The OS and network hops information was not previously available, but also did not provide a specific OS. The previous scan only confirmed a live host via nmap range scan..\nTask 29 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to further investigate open ports 111/tcp and 8080/tcp on node 192.168.0.1". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a detailed analysis of the node 192.168.0.1, identifying it as a live host with an unknown OS, and found open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind 2-4) and 8080/tcp (http using Werkzeug httpd 0.16.0). The scan was unable to determine network hops.\n\n- Changes: The new information found includes the specific versions of rpcbind (2-4) and the http server software (Werkzeug httpd 0.16.0) running on open ports 111/tcp and 8080/tcp respectively. No changes in the OS or network hops information, as it remained unknown and unavailable..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.3\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.".

The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 23 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.5". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan identified a live host on the network with an unknown operating system, one open port (8080/tcp for http-proxy), but was unable to determine network hops.\n- Changes: New information found includes the open port 8080/tcp (http-proxy) which was not previously known. The OS remains unknown, and network hops are still not available, providing no change in that regard..\nTask 25 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct a detailed nmap scan to identify the operating system and additional open ports on node 192.168.0.5". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan identified a live host on the network with an operating system likely being Linux 4.15 - 5.19 or MikroTik RouterOS 7.2 - 7.5, one open port (8080/tcp for http-proxy), and found 1 network hop.\n- Changes: New information found includes the possible operating systems (Linux 4.15 - 5.19, MikroTik RouterOS 7.2 - 7.5) and the number of network hops (1), which were not previously known. The open port 8080/tcp (http-proxy) was previously identified, so no change in that regard..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.4\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 22 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.4". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan attempted to perform a basic network discovery but did not yield specific results about the OS, open ports, or network hops. It found a node via nmap range scan, but further details remain unknown.\n- Changes: No changes..\nTask 26 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform an nmap scan to identify open ports and the operating system on node 192.168.0.4". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan attempted to gather more information about the node 192.168.0.4, but was unable to determine the OS. It found 1 network hop and no open ports were identified.\n- Changes: New information about network hops was found, but OS and open ports remain unknown..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.6\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 24 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.6". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan was a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network. It found a node discovered via nmap range scan, but no additional information such as OS, open ports, or network hops was available.\n\n- Changes: No changes..\nTask 27 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports and the operating system on node 192.168.0.6". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan was a network analysis scan that identified a live host on the network. It found a node with an unknown OS, no open ports identified, and 1 network hop.\n\n- Changes: New information found includes the number of network hops, which was not previously available. The OS and open ports were not identified, providing no additional information in those areas..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.2\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 20 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.2". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a basic network discovery and identified a live host on the network. The scan results show that no operating system was detected, and open ports were found, but the number of open ports was not specified. Network hops information is not available.\n\n- Changes: New information about open ports was found, but no OS detection and network hops data. Compared to existing data, open ports information is new..\nTask 28 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a detailed nmap scan to identify the operating system and specify the number of open ports on node 192.168.0.2". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a network analysis on node 192.168.0.2 and found no operating system detected, no open ports, and no network hops information available.\n- Changes: Compared to existing data, new information was found indicating that there are no open ports detected, and no OS detection and network hops data; replacing previous partial data..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.1\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 19 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.1". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a basic network discovery and identified a live host. The scan found a host with an unknown OS, open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy), but was unable to determine network hops.\n\n- Changes: New information found includes the open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy). The OS and network hops information was not previously available, but also did not provide a specific OS. The previous scan only confirmed a live host via nmap range scan..\nTask 29 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to further investigate open ports 111/tcp and 8080/tcp on node 192.168.0.1". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a detailed analysis of the node 192.168.0.1, identifying it as a live host with an unknown OS, and found open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind 2-4) and 8080/tcp (http using Werkzeug httpd 0.16.0). The scan was unable to determine network hops.\n\n- Changes: The new information found includes the specific versions of rpcbind (2-4) and the http server software (Werkzeug httpd 0.16.0) running on open ports 111/tcp and 8080/tcp respectively. No changes in the OS or network hops information, as it remained unknown and unavailable..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.3\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.".

The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 6 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.5". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan identified a live host on the network with an unknown operating system, an open port 8080 for http-proxy, but was unable to determine network hops.\n- Changes: New information found includes the open port 8080/tcp (http-proxy) which was not previously known. The OS remains unknown, and network hops are still not available, providing some incremental insight into the host\'s configuration..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.1\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 2 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.1". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a basic network discovery and identified a live host. The scan found a node with an unknown OS, open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy), but was unable to determine network hops.\n\n- Changes: New information found includes the open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy). The OS and network hops information was not previously available, but also not previously known. The discovery of open ports is new compared to existing data..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.6\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 7 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.6". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan was a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network. It found a node discovered via nmap range scan, but no additional information such as OS, open ports, or network hops was available.\n\n- Changes: No changes..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.3\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 4 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.3". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan attempted to perform a basic network discovery but did not yield specific results about the OS, open ports, or network hops.

The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 6 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.5". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan identified a live host on the network with an unknown operating system, an open port 8080 for http-proxy, but was unable to determine network hops.\n- Changes: New information found includes the open port 8080/tcp (http-proxy) which was not previously known. The OS remains unknown, and network hops are still not available, providing some incremental insight into the host\'s configuration..\nTask 8 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct a detailed nmap scan to identify the operating system and version on node 192.168.0.5". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan identified a live host on the network with an operating system likely being Linux (versions 4.15 to 5.19 or OpenWrt 21.02, or MikroTik RouterOS 7.2 to 7.5), an open port 8080 for http (Werkzeug httpd 0.16.0), and found 1 network hop.\n- Changes: New information found includes the likely OS (Linux 4.15 - 5.19, OpenWrt 21.02, or MikroTik RouterOS 7.2 - 7.5), and specific software running on port 8080 (Werkzeug httpd 0.16.0). Additionally, network hops were identified, with a total of 1 hop..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.1\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.". The MEMORY AGENT found: node discovered via nmap range scan.\nTask 2 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct an nmap scan to identify open ports on node 192.168.0.1". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed a basic network discovery and identified a live host. The scan found a node with an unknown OS, open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy), but was unable to determine network hops.\n\n- Changes: New information found includes the open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy). The OS and network hops information was not previously available, but also not previously known. The discovery of open ports is new compared to existing data..\nTask 9 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Conduct a detailed nmap scan to identify the operating system and version on node 192.168.0.1". The MEMORY AGENT found: - Summary: The scan performed an nmap scan on node 192.168.0.1, identifying a live host with the Linux 4.15 - 5.19 operating system, open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy), and determined the network hops to be 1.\n\n- Changes: The new information found includes the OS, specifically Linux 4.15 - 5.19, and the network hops, which is 1. The open ports 111/tcp (rpcbind) and 8080/tcp (http-proxy) were previously identified, so there are no changes in that regard..\n\n## Node: 192.168.0.6\n**Assigned Tasks:**\nTask 1 — you asked the EXECUTOR "Perform a basic network discovery scan to identify live hosts on the network.".
